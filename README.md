## Interpretable machine learning with SHAP: An empirical study of the effect of background data sample size on deep learning model explanation
Here we provide open-source code for SHAP fluctuations caused by different background data with the same sample size. Full paper is available from https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11351.  
The Bleu python file contains BLEU function for SHAP-based variable ranking comparison.  
The Simulation Process file includes the whole pipeline for conduction this empirical study.
